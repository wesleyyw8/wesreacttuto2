more this architecture will pay off in scalability, maintainnability, clearity through consistency


when do we use local state? 
when the rest of the application doesnt care about it.


"test": "mocha --reporter progress tools/testSetup.js \"src/**/*.test.js\"",

progress less noise in the console
spec more details in the console (when writing tests)


testing connecting components I should just test the behavior because on the "html" there are just references to child components. So I should test something like (onclick, onscroll, etc)
